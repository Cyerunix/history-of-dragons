        <p id="art-abstract" align="center">Have you ever wanted to try making a small 
            depiction of one of your dragon characters, but found yourself unsure of where 
            to start? Well, this is the tutorial for you! We will go over some of the basics 
            of designing a dragon's head before showing you some of the different ways you 
            can add interesting details! So, grab a pencil and some paper and get ready to 
            scribble some cool creatures down!

                    First, you should draw a circle with a cross running through it. The circle doesn't have to 
                    be perfect! As long as it is roughly circular, it will work just fine.

                    Next, you are going to draw a line in the general direction you want your dragon to be facing, 
                    starting from the point where the two lines you drew intersect. Then, pick a point on that line 
                    and draw extra curved lines starting the edge of the circle where either line touches and ending 
                    at the opposite side of the circle. This will show you the direction the dragon should be facing, 
                    and it will allow you to visualize the three-dimensional shape of your dragon's face. After all, 
                    you don't want your poor dragon to have a flat snoot, do you? (Maybe you do, in which case, that 
                    is fine! Just make sure the face still has some dimensions.)

                <p class="step-description">
                    Now, we need to start drawing that snoot! We start by drawing lines from the corners of the circle
                    to the left and right of the center to arbitrary points near the end of the directional line we
                    drew earlier. This will give us the general shape of the top part of the snout (called the mandible
                    in technical terms). Notice how if we were to connect the three lines at the endpoint, we would
                    have a diagonal line, as opposed to a straight one. This is important because it helps determine 
                    perspective. The endpoints of the lines will vary based on the exact angle your dragon is facing,
                    but usually, you can use the front-facing view as reference. If the dragon were facing you, the
                    artist, the line we would draw between these endpoints would be horizontal. Now, notice that if
                    the dragon turns its head to the right (as is seen in the example image), the right side of the
                    line goes up. If the dragon were to turn to the left instead, the left side of the line would go
                    up, giving us a downward-poining line rather than the upward-pointing one we have. Once you get
                    used to this, you will just know where the endpoints of the snout lines should go.
