                    The Wyvern's origin stems from the word vÄ«pera in Latin. The implication behind the latin word comes from the wyvern's ability to use venom as its main weapon. It was considered to be a flying snake with two legs as it formed the shape of a dragon.

                    The name "Quetzalcoatl" comes from the Nahuatl word for plumed serpent. It was prevalent in folklore across Mesoamerican culture, and is said in myths to be the ancestor of most mesoamerican people. This dragon is often represented as a god, sometimes of the morning star or death.

                   The Quetzalcoatl is a flying serpent dragon with no wings and feathers along its body. It is often depicted as brightly colored due to its connection to the quetzal bird, which are often green, blue, red, and white.
