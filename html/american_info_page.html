            The origin of the Salamander can be found to be based off of real life salamanders, albeit the realistic
            counterpart to be a lot less intimidating than the mythological one. The salamanders of myth can be seen to
            have a lizard-like form with an ability to control fire.

            Known to create and put of fires, the salamanders were very resiliant to hot temperatures as it was one of
            their signature abilities. Sometimes, salamanders could take on fairy-like humanoid statures. Others would
            be used to keep furnances burning day-in and day-out.

          <p class="info-description">
            The name "Quetzalcoatl" comes from the Nahuatl word for plumed serpent. It was prevalent in folklore across
            Mesoamerican culture, and is said in myths to be the ancestor of most mesoamerican people. This dragon is
            often represented as a god, sometimes of the morning star or death.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Heraldry</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            The Quetzalcoatl is a flying serpent dragon with no wings and feathers along its body. It is often depicted
            as brightly colored due to its connection to the quetzal bird, which are often green, blue, red, and white.
