                    The origin of the Salamander can be found to be based off of real life salamanders, albeit the realistic counterpart to be a lot less intimidating than the mythological one. The salamanders of myth can be seen to have a lizard-like form with an ability to control fire.

                  <h2>Folklore</h2>
                  <p>
                    Known to create and put of fires, the salamanders were very resiliant to hot temperatures as it was one of their signature abilities. Sometimes, salamanders could take on fairy-like humanoid statures. Others would be used to keep furnances burning day-in and day-out.
