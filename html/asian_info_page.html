          <p class="info-description">
            The lung dragon which is just a Chinese dragon, is a legendary creature in Chinese mythology, Chinese
            folklore, and Chinese culture as a whole. It is most known for being one of the 12 animals in the Chinese
            zodiac which is used to designate years in the Chinese calendar, but it has ties dating back to almost 4500
            BC. Now in Chinese culture, excellent and outstanding people are compared to a dragon, while incapable
            people with no achievements are compared to other, disesteemed creatures, such as a worm.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info-subheader">Heraldry</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            Lung dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water,
            rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who
            are worthy of it in East Asian culture. Historically, the Chinese dragon would be associated with the
            Emperor of China and used as a symbol to represent his imperial power.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Anatomy</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish but are most commonly depicted as a
            snake-like creatures with four legs. There are currently four reliable theories on the origin of the Chinese
            dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder, and nature worship. From its origins as totems or the stylized
            depiction of natural creatures, the Chinese dragon evolved to become a mythical animal. Scholars from The
            Han
            dynasty scholar recorded Chinese myths that lung dragons had nine anatomical resemblances. These resemblances
            included the antlers of a deer, the head of a crocodile, a demon's eyes, the neck of a snake, a tortoise's
            viscera, a hawk's claws, the palms of a tiger, and a cow's ears. They were believed to hear through their
            horns, as their ears were unable to hear anything.
