                  <p>
                   The Wyvern's origin stems from the word vÄ«pera in Latin. The implication behind the latin word comes from the wyvern's ability to use venom as its main weapon. It was considered to be a flying snake with two legs as it formed the shape of a dragon.

                  <h2>Heraldry</h2>
                  <p>
                   Oftentimes represented on English war banners during the early 8th century, Wyverns, overtime, became a symbol of courage and strength. Now, wyverns can be seen as a common logo or mascot, seeing lots of representation, especially in the country of Wales.
