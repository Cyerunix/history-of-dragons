          <p class="info-description">
            The word "dragon" now serves as a sort of umbrella term for a large number of mythological serpentine
            creatures. The concept of the dragon emerged within many different cultures across the world, many of which
            had no prior contact with one another. This makes it very difficult to trace them back to a singular point.
            One of the earliest known depictions of a dragon comes from sculptures that were made sometime between 4500
            and 3000 BC in China. The depiction here is much more similar to <a
              href="asian_info_page.html#lung-dragon-header">lung dragons</a>, however, rather than the Western dragons
            we know today.
            <br><br>
            Another ancient depiction of the dragon that is slightly closer to Western dragons comes
            from Mesopotamia, circa 2100 BC. This draconic creature is known as the Mušḫuššu. They are similar to other
            mythological creatures such as the manticore or the chimera in that they are a sort of amalgamation of many
            different creatures. While it also differs significantly from the dragons we know and love today, it is also
            remarkably similar given how long ago it sprung up.
            <br><br>
            The first visual depiction of a dragon resembling the dragons we see in popular culture in more recent times
            can be traced back to circa 1260 AD. The dragon that was illustrated had a far longer tail than usual and an
            extra set of wings, but other than that, it looked to be quite similar to modern dragons.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Heraldry</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            Arguably one of the most notable case of dragons being used in heraldry is on the Welsh flag. The red dragon
            that is depicted on the flag comes from a story titled <cite>History of the Kings of Britain</cite> where a
            warlord named Vortigern tries to build a tower on a hill that happens to cover a pool housing two dragons.
            After the tower falls into the ground a few times, the warlord is informed of the dragon situation by a
            child prophet named Merlin. Upon discovering this, Vortigern drains the pool, exposing a red and a white
            dragon, both of which immediately begin to fight with each other. Merlin prophesizes that the white dragon,
            symbolizing England, will defeat the red dragon, symbolizing Wales, but the red dragon will return later to
            defeat the white dragon. This story represents the conquest of Wales by England, and the dragon on the Welsh
            flag later became symbolic of their eventual triumph.

            Depictions of Western dragons (not to be confused with any other type of dragon) stemming all the way back
            to the Middle Ages have remained relatively consistent throughout history. Western dragons in particular are
            large, reptilian creatures with four legs, two wings, lots of horns and spikes, and a long tail.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Origin</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            The Wyvern's origin stems from the word vīpera in Latin. The implication behind the latin word comes from
            the wyvern's ability to use venom as its main weapon. It was considered to be a flying snake with two legs
            as it formed the shape of a dragon.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Heraldry</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            Oftentimes represented on English war banners during the early 8th century, Wyverns, overtime, became a
            symbol of courage and strength. Now, wyverns can be seen as a common logo or mascot, seeing lots of
            representation, especially in the country of Wales.

          <p class="info-description">
            Wyverns are similar in body structure to dragons, but instead of having four legs and wings, their front
            legs are merged into their wings, leaving them with just four limbs instead of six.

          <p class="info-description">
            The lindwurm is a mythical creature in Northern and Central European folklore. They were known to live deep
            in the forest and traditionally have the shape of a giant serpent monster. They have origins in Sweden and
            much of Central Europe, all with their little differences of what one actually is.

          <h2 class="info-subheader">Heraldry</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            A lindwurm in heraldry is basically a dragon without wings. Another definition for it would be a dragon with
            four feet and wings that are smaller than usual dragons. They would be discussed in tales and even depicted
            on military crests of certain villages and kingdoms.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info-subheader">Anatomy</h2>
          <p class="info-description">
            In Swedish folklore, lindwurms appear as giant forest serpents without limbs, living between rocks deep in
            the forest. They were said to be dark in color with a brightly colored underside. Along its spine, it has
            fish-like dorsal fins and a mane similar to that of a horse. For defense and attack, it would spit out a
            milk-like substance that would blind its enemies. In Central Europe, the lindwurms usually resembled a
            dragon or something very similar to it. They usually appear with a scaly serpentine body, a dragon's head,
            and two clawed forelimbs. Some would also have wings. Most limbed depictions show that lindwurms do not walk
            on their limbs. Instead, they slither similarly to a snake and use their arms for traction.
